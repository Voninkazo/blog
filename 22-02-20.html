        Hello everyone, My name is Sandy and I am from Madagascar. I am a nineteen year old girl just trying to be a web
        developer. I am studying english and coding at an english school called
        <a href="https://web.facebook.com/OnjaAfrica/?_rdc=1&_rdr">
          Onja
        </a>
        in oder to achieve my goal. In my
        life I had some ups and downs but I am pleased that it is now going rather good. Because I have got the
        opportunity to study at this lovely school, I have the hope that my future life will be good.
      </p>

        I was learning to communicate with many people from different places when I realized that being open minded is a
        very useful attribute we should have if we want to improve in our life. So I love talking to people no matter where
        they are from and sharing interesting things, that is why I am writing my blog. I believe mindfulness in the
        workplace is the key of success especially for our country.

          My family
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a farmer's daughter from a little town called Antanandava. In my family, I am the oldest child among my
          parents'childreen. I have two sisters and a brother who is the
          youngest, they are all still studying. But I haven't been living with them for about a year because of my
          study. Last December I had three
          weeks of vacation, it was so nice playing and working together with them. I would suggest that it is always
          good to have a break from your work and spend some time with your families and peers. So family is very
          important as this proverb says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <i>Children are a poor manâ€™s riches.</i>
        </blockquote>
        Which means a poor man finds wealth through his children, partially because they bring him joy, and also
        because they are his legacy.
