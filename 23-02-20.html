        Crime is the act of doing something criminal and it is against the law. It can cause physical or psycological
        problems to the victims.

          In many countries, teenagers are responsible for a high proportion of criminal acts. It is resulted from the
          extreme behaviours that appeared from dysfunctional families. Because there is no supervision from parents or
          caregivers, children's behaviours such as aggression,hostility are given a complete freedom to develop in
          their later lives. As many of us acknowledge, childreen can easily learn and imitate what are going around the
          community especially inside their families. In that case, it is hard for them to get rid of these bad
          abilities, then it affects the countries'safety.

      <p>
        It is obviousily showed in everyday life that childreen who are friend with antisocial peers copy thier
        behaviours. That is because they don't have the opportinuty to attend school for example, so the only thing
        comes
        in their minds is stealing or bieng a murder. Also media plays an
        important role in shaping children's behaviours. For example, games that are requiring violent acts encourage
        young players to commit crimes and give them the impression that it is acceptable to do. So crime is born from
        the bad generations.

        Imprisonment is often cosidered as a way to punish juvenile offenders but it can produce extremely destructive
        effects. Young children can potentialy be victims of physical or sexual abuse from the older prisoners, as well
        as can adopt their behaviours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my thinking, through educational and training, the youth can realise their wrongful actions and be given
        opportinuties to turn over a new life and transform themselves into useful members of society later. So I feel
        that
        <em>
          government
        </em>
        should take a decision on what to do to increase the number of school in many countries, as
        well as the poor children can attend school to prevent them from bieng juvenile offenders.
        And in order to grow the young generations up, it is efficient to give them love, besides education. Love is the
        greatest way to change children's mindset, because they will understand that the reason way you correct them is
        that you love them but not selfishness. That is why it is important to give love, care, and support to the
        children when they are still young.
