          Crime is the act of doing something criminal and it is against the law. It can cause physical or psychological
          problems to the victims.In many countries, teenagers are responsible for a high proportion of criminal acts.
          It is resulted from the extreme behaviours that appeared from dysfunctional families. Because there is no
          supervision from parents or caregivers, children's behaviours such as aggression,hostility are given a
          complete freedom to develop in their later lives. As many of us acknowledge, children can easily learn and
          imitate what is going on around the community, especially inside their families. In this instance, it is hard
          for them to reverse these bad examples and it affects the general country's safety.

        It has been shown that children mixing around with antisocial behaviors characters tend to be influenced by
        these people. Antisocial behaviors can be the result of lack of opportunity to attend schools, having good role
        models as mentors and parents and families setting good examples in everyday lives. That is because they don't
        have the opportinuty to attend school for example, lifes so the only thing comes in their minds is stealing or
        being a murder. Also the media plays an important role in shaping children's behaviours. For example, games that
        are requiring violent acts encourage young players to commit crimes and give them the impression that it is
        acceptable to do. So crime is born from the bad generations.

        What would be a solution for that?Imprisonment is often considered as a way to punish juvenile offenders but it
        also can produce extremely destructive effects. Young children can potentialy be victims of physical or sexual
        abuse from the older prisoners, as well as can adopt their behaviours. I feel that the government should take a
        decision on what to do to increase the number of schools in many countries, as well as the poor children can
        attend school to prevent them from being juvenile offenders. And in order to grow the young generations up, it
        is efficient to give them love, besides education. Love is the greatest way to change children's mindset,
        because they will understand that the reason why we correct them is that we love them but not selfishness.
        Showing love, care, support and being good role models to young children are the best form foundation you can
        give to the younger generation.
