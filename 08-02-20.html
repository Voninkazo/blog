                    Ambatondrazaka District. It is located in the TOAMASINA pronvince which is in the Est of Madagascar.
                    This city is pretty vast and crowded. There are many other special and amaizing things about this
                    city,
                    so I am going to give more details.

                <p>
                    The entire population who originated from Ambatondrazaka are called "sihanaka" which is a small
                    tribe of
                    rice farmers and fishermen, representing about 2.5% of the population of Madagascar. Their home are
                    the
                    northern highlands, North-East of the old kingdom of Imerina around Lake Alaotra with Ambatondrazaka
                    being the capital.

                    As in all of Madagascar, the majority of the residents from the Alaotra Mangoro Region are farmers.
                    They
                    plant rice which is the city famous for, and other crops such as corn, beans and peanuts. This
                    situation shows the fact that the Alaotra Mangoro region constitutes one of the important cities in our
                    country.
                    For some people who have professional jobs, thay have their own daily lives but all are trying to develop
                    the
                    city.

                        Amaizing places where you can visite to
                    </h2>

                            <b>Zahamena National Park</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Zahamena is a combination of two words which are "zahana"(tree name) and "mena"(red colour), that's why the park is called Zahamena. This tree is invaluable and unique because we can not find it anywhere else. The park is quite vast and contains natural resources like precious stone.
                         What's more, you can find both nocturnal and diurnal animals, that tells us the density of the forest.
                        There are a lot of visitors from different places visite this park every year.
                        A part from that, there is a waterfall followed by a natural swimming pool which is in the middle of the park.
                        These are some interesting things exist in there.
