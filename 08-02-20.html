      <p>
        Ambatondrazaka is a city in Madagascar. It is also the capital of the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaotra-Mangoro">Alaotra-Mangoro</a> region and the
        Ambatondrazaka District. It is located in the TOAMASINA pronvince which is in the Est of Madagascar.
        This city is pretty vast and crowded. There are many other special and amaizing things about this
        city,
        so I am going to give more details.

          What kind of people are there and what are mostly the ways the population survive?
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The entire population who originated from Ambatondrazaka are called "sihanaka" which is a small
        tribe of
        rice farmers and fishermen, representing about 2.5% of the population of Madagascar. Their home are
        the
        northern highlands, North-East of the old kingdom of Imerina around Lake Alaotra with Ambatondrazaka
        being the capital. The sihanaka people have their traditional way of clothing which is heritated from their
        ancestors. Usually, women wear a big hat and <a

        which covers the skirts or trousers.

        As many regions, the majority of the residents from the Alaotra Mangoro Region are farmers.
        They
        plant rice, and that is what this city famous for, and other crops such as corn, beans and peanuts. This
        situation shows the fact that the Alaotra Mangoro region constitutes one of the important cities in our
        country.
        For some people who have professional jobs, they have their own daily lives but all are trying to develop the
        city.

          How about fishing?
        </h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Most of the men in our town are fishers, and that is one of the
        main money resources for the families. They use canoes to commute across the lake everyday. It
        lake is vast as it is the biggest lake in Madagascar. It also contains many varieties of fish. Here are
        some photos.

          Amaizing places where you can visite to
        </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Zahamena National Park</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Zahamena is a combination of two words which are "zahana"(tree name) and "mena"(red colour), that's why the park
        is called Zahamena. This tree is invaluable and unique because we can not find it anywhere else. The park is
        quite vast and contains natural resources like precious stone.
        What's more, you can find both nocturnal and diurnal animals, that tells us the density of the forest.
        There are a lot of visitors from different places visite this park every year.
        A part from that, there is a waterfall followed by a natural swimming pool which is in the middle of the park.
        These are some interesting things exist in there.

          What ways of transport do they use?
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The city is at the MAL (Moramanga- Alaotra-Lake) railway. There is also an airport. The national road number
        44 links this city to Moramanga (about 158 km). People are mostly using buses for further travel, but there is
        also kubota which farmers use kubota to transport products from the ricefields.
