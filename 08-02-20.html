        This city is pretty vast and crowded. There are many other special and amaizing things about this

          What kind of people are there and what are mostly the ways the residents survive?
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The entire population who originated from Ambatondrazaka are called "sihanaka" which is a small
        tribe of
        rice farmers and fishermen, representing about 2.5% of the population of Madagascar. Their home are the northern
        highlands, North-East of the old kingdom of Imerina around Lake Alaotra with Ambatondrazaka being the capital.
        The sihanaka people have their traditional way of clothing which is heritated from their
        ancestors. Usually, women wear a big hat and <a

        which covers the skirts or trousers.

        As in all of Madagascar, the majority of the residents from the Alaotra Mangoro Region are farmers.
        They plant rice which is the city famous for, and other crops such as corn, beans and peanuts. This situation
        shows the fact that the Alaotra Mangoro region constitutes one of the important cities in our country.
        For some people who have professional jobs, they have their own daily lives and are trying to develop the city.

          How about fishing?
        </h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Most of the men in our town are fishers, and this is one of the
        main money resources for the families. They use canoes to commute across the alaotra mangoro lake everyday. This
        lake is very vast as it is the biggest lake in Madagascar. It also contains many varieties of fish. Here are
        some photos.

          Amaizing places where you can visit to
        </h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Zahamena National Park</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Zahamena is a combination of two malagasy words which are "zahana"(tree name) and "mena"(red colour), that is
        the reason why the park is called Zahamena. This big red tree is invaluable and unique because we can not find
        it anywhere else.
        The park is quite vast and contains natural resources like precious stones.
        What's more, you can find both nocturnal and diurnal animals, that tells us the density of the forest. A part
        from that, there is a waterfall followed by a natural swimming pool which is in the middle of the park.
        Every year, many visitors come to visit this park and live in adventure.
        You can see that from these following photos.

          What ways of transport do we use?

      <p>
        The city is at the MAL (Moramanga Alaotra Lake) railway. There is also an airport. The national road number 44
        links this city to Moramanga (about 158 km). People are mostly using buses for further travel, and kubota to
        trasport the products.
